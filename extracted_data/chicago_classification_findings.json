  "Chicago Classification Findings*": "EGJ: Normal Relaxation\nMedian IRP (6.2 mmHg) is less than 15 mmHg\nEsophageal body: Ineffective swallows, Not all swallows have failed peristalsis\n% ineffective swallows (96%) is greater than 50%\nFinding: Ineffective Esophageal Motility (IEM)\n* Findings are based on published Chicago Classification scheme and are only intended to serve as a guide for patient diagnosis",
  "Procedure": "36 Channel solid state Esophageal High resolution Manometry\nStudy: Catheter was placed in fasting state , in supine position with run in period of 5 minutes.\nRecording for 30 seconds were done at the baseline\n10 wet swallows were evaluated, each of 5 ml water as bolus , with minimum gap of 30 seconds\nbetween the swallows.\n5 upright swallows were taken\nRDC of 200ml 0.45 saline was done in sitting position.\n10 ML 5 Wet swallows have been taken\n5 Solid  meal swallows have been taken",
  "Indications": "GERD",
  "Interpretation / Findings": "15 wet swallows performed. Resting LES pressures normal\nMore than 50% of swallows show a DCI < 450 suggestive of poor oesophageal contraction\nLES relaxation is normal"
